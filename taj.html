    <p> The Colosseum in Rome is the largest amphitheater ever built and a marvel of ancient Roman engineering. Completed in AD 80, it hosted gladiatorial contests, animal hunts, and public spectacles for crowds of up to 80,000 people. Despite its partial ruin, it stands as a symbol of the grandeur of the Roman Empire.</p>
